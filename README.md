# Capstone_Initial_Report

 Initial Report and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 1. I decided to pursue the concept of MoneyBall, where a second-tier Baseball GM and an Economics Major decided to build a team based on Statistical Principals.
 2. My goal is use a high-level view of Data that Billy Beane used to develop metrics and predict the performance of his team based on Regression.
 3. I chose to approach the same dataset and perform multiple Regressions and run a classification model to test the strength of each regression.
 4. Please see the attached Jupyter Notebook for my initial Analysis.
